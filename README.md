Overview of the project
Hello everyone in this project we gonna get code from GitHub and make a docker image with the help of a docker file and push it into Amazon ECR(Elastic Container Registry) and then run this in Amazon ECS(Elastic Container Service) with the help of Fargate which is a serverless architecture through task definition.

AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run Docker containers without managing the underlying infrastructure. It automatically provisions the required resources for your containers and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it easy to deploy and manage container workloads at scale.
